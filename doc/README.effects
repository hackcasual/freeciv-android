The effects.ruleset file contains all effects in play in a Freeciv scenario. 
They have the following form (this is perhaps the most complicated example I 
could find):

[effect_hydro_plant]
name  = "Output_Bonus"
value = 25
reqs  =
    { "type", "name", "range"
      "Building", "Factory", "City"
      "Building", "Hydro Plant", "City"
      "OutputType", "Shield", "Local"
    }
nreqs =
    { "type", "name", "range"
      "Building", "Hoover Dam", "Player"
      "Building", "Nuclear Plant", "City"
    }

The text in the brackets is the entry name, which just has to be unique, but 
is otherwise not used. The name field tells Freeciv which effect you are 
defining.  The value is the effect's value, which depends on which effect it 
is. The reqs table contain a list of requirements for this effect being in 
effect. You need to satisfy all requirements listed here for this effect to 
take effect in the game.  Lastly there is the nreqs table which is the 
opposite of the reqs field, these are conditions which prevent the effect from 
taking place. Any one of the nreq conditions will prevent the effect from 
taking effect.

Value is integral amount parameter for many effects (must be in the range 
-32767 to 32767).

Requirement range may be one of: "None", "Local", "Adjacent", "City", 
"Continent", "Player", "World". Some requirement types may only work at 
certain ranges; this is not yet documented. In particular, at present, 
"Continent" effects can affect only cities and units in cities.

A requirement may have a survives field, and if this is '1', the effect 
survives destruction (wonders only).

A requirement may have a negated field, and if this is '1', the requirement
is negated.

A requirement type is the type of the requirement and can be one of "None" 
(default), "Tech", "Gov", "Building", "Special", "Terrain", "UnitType", 
"UnitFlag", "UnitClass", "Nation", "OutputType", "MinYear", "MinSize", "AI",
"TerrainClass", "TerrainAlter", or "CityTile". MinSize is the minimum size
of a city required. AI is ai player difficulty level. TerrainClass is either
"Land" or "Oceanic". Only "Center" is supported as CityTile type.
