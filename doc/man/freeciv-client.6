.SH DESCRIPTION
Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player
becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
To become the greatest civilization.

aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.

Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is
easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there!

This is the client program used to connect to a Freeciv server - See also
.IR freeciv-server (6)

This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details
regarding the options when using
.B freeciv-gtk2
.B freeciv-sdl
.B freeciv-xaw
.B freeciv-win32
or
.B freeciv-ftwl
see the Client Manual which can be found at
.UR
http://www.freeciv.org/
.UE
as well as the documentation which is part of the Freeciv distribution.
.SH OPTIONS
All the Freeciv clients accept of the standard X Toolkit command line
options along with the additional options listed below. Those may not
be combined; that is, "\-np caesar 5557" will not work, instead you
 would need to enter "\-n caesar \-p 5557". All options have a short
form (single hyphen and single letter) and a long form (double hyphen
and a complete word); their effects are identical.
.TP
.BI "\-A, \-\-announce \fIprotocol\fP"
Uses \fIprotocol\fP when searching game from LAN.
Possible values for \fIprotocol\fP are:

\fBIPv4\fP

\fBIPv6\fP

\fBnone\fP
.TP
.BI "\-a, \-\-autoconnect"
Skips the connect dialog, automatically inserting the default values. This is
quite convenient when all has been set up properly.
.TP
.BI "\-d \fIlevel_number\fP, \-\-debug \fIlevel_number\fP"
Sets the amount of debugging information to be logged in the file named by the
.I \-l
option. Acceptable values for the \fIlevel_number\fP are:

\fB0\fP    for fatal messages only.

\fB2\fP    for fatal, error and normal messages.

\fB3\fP    for fatal, error, normal, and verbose messages.

instead.
.TP

standard Freeciv metaserver is used. 
.TP
.BI "\-n \fIstring\fP, \-\-name \fIstring\fP"
Specifies the name (\fIstring\fP) to play under. This option is critical when

prompt. (for spawned server only)

.TP
.BI "\-t \fIstring\fP, \-\-tiles \fIstring\fP"

.TP
.BI FREECIV_CAPS
