______________
First of all :
--------------

 -  Some part of graphics and SDL gfx code come from Michael Speck
    and his "LGeneral" (GPL). Great thanks for his job.
     
 -  The zoom and putline functions come from SDL_gfx-2.0 lib (LGPL).
    AA_ZoomSurfaceFastRGBA(...) function and some others in SDLClient
    are my invention.
 
_____________
Requirements:
-------------

SDL
SDL_image ( req: libpng )
FreeType2
iconv

To compile use:

autogen.sh
configure --enable-client=sdl
make
and pray :)

See also the section on SDLClient in INSTALL

__________
Some Info:
----------

Current default GUI theme is "Human" by Hogne HÃ¥skjold. To use
another theme, start the client with the --theme yourtheme option.

See also http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/Themes

If you have current cvs version of SDL (or >= 1.2.6) then uncomment
#define SDL_CVS line (36) from gui-sdl/mapview.c

If your CPU has MMX1 registers then goto gui-sdl/graphics.h line 31 and 
#define HAVE_MMX1 parm.

If you want report draw bug in SDLClient then please attach your 
screen bits per pixel coding.
