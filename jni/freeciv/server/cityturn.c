/***************************************************************************
  Helper function to calculate a "score" of a city. The score is used to get
  an estimate of the "migration desirability" of the city. The higher the
  score the more likely citizens will migrate to it.

  The score depends on the city size, the feeling of its citizens, the cost
  of all buildings in the city, and the surplus of trade, luxury and
  science.

  formula:
    score = ([city size] + feeling) * factors

  * feeling of the citizens
    feeling = 1.00 * happy citizens
            + 0.00 * content citizens
            - 0.25 * unhappy citizens
            - 0.50 * angry citizens

  * factors
    * the build costs of all buildings
      f = (1 + (1 - exp(-[build shield cost]/1000))/5)
    * the trade of the city
      f = (1 + (1 - exp(-[city surplus trade]/100))/5)
    * the luxury within the city
      f = (1 + (1 - exp(-[city surplus luxury]/100))/5)
    * the science within the city
      f = (1 + (1 - exp(-[city surplus science]/100))/5)

  all factors f have values between 1 and 1.2; the overall factor will be
  between 1.0 (smaller cities) and 2.0 (bigger cities)

  [build shield cost], [city surplus trade], [city surplus luxury] and
  [city surplus science] _must_ be >= 0!

  The food furplus is considered by an additional factor

    * the food surplus of the city
      f = (1 + [city surplus food]/10)

  * if the city has at least one wonder a factor of 1.25 is added
  * for the capital an additional factor of 1.25 is used
  * the score is also modified by the effect EFT_MIGRATION_PCT
