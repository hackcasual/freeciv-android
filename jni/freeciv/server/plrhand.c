Capturing a nation's capital is a devastating blow.  This function
creates a new AI player, and randomly splits the original players
city list into two.  Of course this results in a real mix up of 
teritory - but since when have civil wars ever been tidy, or civil.

Embassies:  All embassies with other players are lost.  Other players
            retain their embassies with pplayer.
 * Units:      Units inside cities are assigned to the new owner
            of the city.  Units outside are transferred along 
            with the ownership of their supporting city.
            If the units are in a unit stack with non rebel units,
            then whichever units are nearest an allied city
            are teleported to that city.  If the stack is a 
            transport at sea, then all rebel units on the 
            transport are teleported to their nearest allied city.

Cities:     Are split randomly into 2.  This results in a real
            mix up of teritory - but since when have civil wars 
            ever been tidy, or for any matter civil?
 *
One caveat, since the spliting of cities is random, you can
conceive that this could result in either the original player
or the rebel getting 0 cities.  To prevent this, the hack below
ensures that each side gets roughly half, which ones is still 
determined randomly.
