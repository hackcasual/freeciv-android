Dependencies:

Eclipse (http://eclipse.org)
Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
Android Developer Tools Eclipse Plugin (http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adt.html)
Android NDK from CrystaX (http://www.crystax.net/android/ndk-r4.php)
commons-compress (http://commons.apache.org/compress/)
guava (http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/)
Java 1.6 JDK (http://www.sun.com)
Cygwin (http://cygwin.org) # If you are developing on windows

Development has been done solely on Windows to date, however all tools 
should work fine under Linux and OS X.

Getting Started:

If you've never developed for Android before, work through a few examples, 
including a NDK based project.

Once you are comfortable using Eclipse, create a new Android project using 
existing source, and point it to the directory you unpacked this 
distribution in. Select Android 2.1 for the SDK level.

Make sure you select Java 1.6 as the target SDK, and add guava and 
commons-compress as libs to the project.

For the C libraries, you will need libpng setup. Follow the instructions in
jni/libpng.

You will need to build the shared object files using ndk-build from the
root directory of the project.

Pro tip: use ndk-build -j4 to build with 4 processes, big speed up for
multi-core systems.

Once the shared objects are built, refresh the libs directory in Eclipse,
clean, then run the project. Select a connected device or use an emulator.
